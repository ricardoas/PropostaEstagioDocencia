@book{thinking_in_java,
    abstract = {{<I>Thinking in Java</I> is a printed version of Bruce Eckel's online materials that provides a useful perspective on mastering Java for those with previous programming experience. The author's take on the essence of Java as a new programming language and the thorough introduction to Java's features make this a worthwhile tutorial.<p> <I>Thinking in Java</I> begins a little esoterically, with the author's reflections on why Java is new and better. (This book's choice of font for chapter headings is remarkably hard on the eyes.) The author outlines his thoughts on why Java will make you a better programmer, without all the complexity. The book is better when he presents actual language features. There's a tutorial to basic Java types, keywords, and operators. The guide includes extensive source code that is sometimes daunting (as with the author's sample code for <I>all</I> the Java operators in one listing.) As such, this text will be most useful for the experienced developer.<p> The text then moves on to class design issues, when to use inheritance and composition, and related topics of information hiding and polymorphism. (The treatment of inner classes and scoping will likely seem a bit overdone for most readers.) The chapter on Java collection classes for both Java Developer's Kit (JDK) 1.1 and the new classes, such as sets, lists, and maps, are much better. There's material in this chapter that you are unlikely to find anywhere else.<p> Chapters on exception handling and programming with type information are also worthwhile, as are the chapters on the new Swing interface classes and network programming. Although it adopts somewhat of a mixed-bag approach, <I>Thinking in Java</I> contains some excellent material for the object-oriented developer who wants to see what all the fuss is about with Java.  } {The legendary author Bruce Eckel brings Java to life with this extraordinarily insightful, opinionated and downright funny introduction. <I>Thinking in Java</i> introduces all of the language's fundamentals, one step at a time, using to-the-point code examples. More than virtually any other book, <I>Thinking in Java</i> helps you understand not just what to do -- but why. Eckel introduces all the basics of objects as Java uses them; then walks carefully through the fundamental concepts underlying all Java programming -- including program flow, initialization and cleanup, hiding implementations, reusing classes and polymorphism. Using extensive, to-the-point examples, he introduces error handling, exceptions, Java I/O, run-time type identification, and passing and returning objects. He covers the Java AWT, multithreading, network programming with Java -- even design patterns. The best way to understand the real value of this book is to hear what readers of the online version have been saying about it: "much better than any other Java book I've seen, by an order of magnitude..." "mature, consistent, intellectually honest, well-written and precise..." "a thoughtful, penetrating analytical tutorial which doesn't kowtow to the manufacturers..." "Thank you again for your awesome book. I was really floundering, but your book has brought me up to speed as quickly as I could read it!"For both beginner and experienced C and C++ programmers who want to learn Java.  <P>* From the basics of object development, all the way to design patterns and other advanced topics.  <P>* By the author of the best-selling Thinking in C++ -- winner of the 1995 Jolt Cola Award!  <P>* On-line version has already received tens of thousands of hits -- there's a huge built-in demand for this book!}},
